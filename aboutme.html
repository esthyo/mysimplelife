        <h2>My name is Esther, and living the simple life, saved my life</h2>
 
        <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things I thought I loved, but the truth was I cound not appreciate any of it because there was too much</p>
        <p>Tings were terrible. i had a job that i hated, a home that i did not want to live in, and i could not hold a relatioship</p>

        <h3>How I turned thngs around</h3>
        <p><strong>I was on the average of a breakdown when i got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and i quit my job</p>
        <p>It was not easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, i did not know what else to do. And it worked.</p>

        <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
        <p>Now that I a living a simple life, things are so much better. I am less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free to to enjoy.</p>
        <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like i had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from livig a simple life as well, which is why i started this website!</strong></p>
